Chapter 59: The DOM : parents and children

what is the DOM?(Quick Recap)
  The DOM is a tree-like structure where every HTML element is a node.
  The structure starts from the document object , which represents the entire page, and 
  branches out to individual element like div,p,h1,etc.

understanding parents and childrens  
  parents Node:
      Any element that contains another element is called a parent.
      <div>
         <p>hello, world</p>
      </div>   

      here, div is the parent node.

    child Node:  
       The element inside a parent are its children.
         <div>
         <p>hello, world</p>
        </div>

        here p is child node.

        single child:
        <div>
         <p>hello, world</p>
        </div>

        here p is  single child node.

        multiple children:
        <div>
         <p>hello, world</p>
         <span>hello, world</span>
        </div>

        here p and span are   multiple children nodes.
